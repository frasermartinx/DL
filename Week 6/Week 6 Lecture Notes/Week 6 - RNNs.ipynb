    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last week of the module we studied a very important neural network network architecture that is the convolutional neural network. You learned the operations that are carried out by convolutional layers and pooling layers, as well as the hyperparameter choices within those layers and the effect they can have on the layer outputs. We also covered transposed convolutions, which can be thought of as a reverse analog to the regular convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main motivations for developing convolutional neural networks was to design a model that captures important structural properties that we know are contained in the data. CNNs have an equivariance property that means they're adapted well for image data, because we know that in images, we want to be able to detect the same features in different regions of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week of the course, we will look at another very important and widespread model architecture, which is the recurrent neural network (RNN). This is another network type where we deliberately build structure into the network itself in order to capture certain aspects of the data. In the case of recurrent neural networks, these are intended for sequence data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine the different possible types of sequence modelling tasks, and see how RNNs are very flexible models that can be used in many different configurations. You'll learn the basic RNN computation, and more sophisticated architectures such as stacked RNNs, bidirectional layers, and the long short term memory architecture (LSTM).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also see how to implement all of these models and layer types using the TensorFlow RNN API, as well as learning about some of the preprocessing and embedding layers available in TensorFlow."

    "A particular challenge with sequential data and modelling tasks is that the sequence lengths can vary from one dataset example to the next. This makes the use of a fixed input size architecture such as the MLP unsuitable. In addition, there can be many different types of sequential modelling tasks that we might want to consider, each of which could have different architectural requirements, as illustrated in the following diagram. \n",

    "Let $\\{\\mathbf{x}_t\\}_{t=1}^T$ be an example sequence input, with each $\\mathbf{x}_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^D$. Suppose that we are in the many-to-many setting, and there is a corresponding sequence of labels $\\{{y}_t\\}_{t=1}^T$, with $y_t\\in Y$, where $Y$ could be $\\{0, 1\\}$ for a binary classification task for example.\n",

    "Recurrent neural networks make use of WEIGHT SHARING similar to convolutional neural networks, but this time the weights are shared across time. This allows the RNN to be 'unrolled' for as many time steps as there are in the data input $\\mathbf{x}$. THIS IS QUITE AN ASSUMPTION.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RNN also has a **persistent state**, in the form of the hidden layer $\\mathbf{h}^{(1)}$. This hidden state can carry information over an arbitrary number of time steps, and so predictions at a given time step $t$ can depend on events that occurred at any point in the past, at least in principle. As with MLPs, the hidden state stores **distributed representations** of information, which allows them to store a lot of information, in contrast to hidden Markov models, which take discrete states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the computation \\eqref{rnn1}-\\eqref{rnn2} requires an **initial hidden state** $\\mathbf{h}^{(1)}_0$ to be defined. In practice, this is often just set to the zero vector, although it can also be learned as additional parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, the RNN is available as the layer `SimpleRNN` in the `tf.keras.layers` module (see [the docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/SimpleRNN)). It can be included in the list of layers passed to the `Sequential` constructor, or using the functional API."
