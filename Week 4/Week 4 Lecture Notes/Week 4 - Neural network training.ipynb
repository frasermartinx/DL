    "In the last week of the module we studied the error backpropagation algorithm, which is the central algorithm used to compute gradients in the training of neural networks. We also saw how to use the automatic differentiation tools in TensorFlow, as well as introduced data pipelines with the tf.data module. Finally, we saw two commonly used techniques used in deep learning models, which are dropout and batch normalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this week of the course, we will continue to look at neural network training, with a focus on the practical techniques that are used to successfully train these models. We will study various optimisation algorithms that are used, as well as regularisation techniques and weight initialisation strategies. \n",

    "There is no single answer for which optimiser is best to use, as it very often depends on the data and the model. Optimisers with adaptive learning rates tend to convergence faster in most situations, and are more frequently chosen than plain SGD in most situations. However, it is interesting to note that SGD has been shown to generalise better ([Hardt et al 2015](#Hardt15)), and techniques such as switching from Adam to SGD during training have been proposed ([Keskar & Socher 2017](#Keskar17)). Further methods include annealed learning rates, cyclic learning rates ([Smith 2015](#Smith15)) and decaying momentum ([Chen & Kyrillidis 2019](#Chen19)). Many advances have been made in recent years, and neural network optimisation is still very much an active research area.\n",

    "## Weight regularisation and early stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models are typically very over-parameterised, often with millions of parameters over many layers in the model. They are universal approximators (see e.g. [Cybenko](#Cybenko89) for the large width case, or [Lu et al](#Lu17) for the large depth case), and so overfitting can be a problem. When training neural networks, it is important to regularise them to prevent overfitting. As written above, there are several forms of regularisation, but in this section we will look at three in particular: weight regularisation, dropout and early stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $\\mathcal{l}^2$ and $\\mathcal{l}^1$ regularisation\n",
    "Recall that for a linear model of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_j w_j \\phi_j(\\mathbf{x}),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "a typical regularisation is to add a sum of squares penalty term to the loss term to discourage the weights $w_j$ from growing too large. In this case, the regularised loss takes the form\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L_0$ is the unconstrained loss function, and $\\alpha_2$ is a regularisation hyperparameter. This is $\\mathcal{l}^2$ regularisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This form of regularisation is often referred to as **weight decay**, although the two terms are technically not the same. Weight decay ([Hanson & Pratt](#Hanson88)) is defined as a modification to the update rule, rather than to the loss function itself:\n",

In the case of stochastic gradient descent, the update $g_t = \\nabla_\\theta L(\\theta_t; \\mathcal{D}_m)$ and the two formulations are equivalent. However, this is not the case for all gradient-based optimisers commonly used in deep learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "You might have found in the last week that it is difficult to set a good number of epochs to train for ahead of time. In the simple MNIST example training is quick so it is not a problem to experiment, but in many cases training could take hours or days (or even longer!) and so this is not an option. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that deep learning models are usually vastly overparameterised, and have the capacity to drastically overfit. A simple but effective method is to simply stop the training before the model starts to overfit. The picture is similar to the balance between capacity and generalisation:\n",

This means that the model needs to be regularly evaluated on a held-out validation set (that is not used for training), and the optimisation routine is terminated when the validation error starts to rise. Validation is normally performed once per epoch in the training run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the validation error measurements will be noisy, and so it is not a reliable measure to simply detect when the validation error increases and immediately stop the training. What is usually done is to periodically save model checkpoints (say once per epoch), and set a **patience** threshold, to specify a maximum number of validation runs that are allowed where the validation error does not improve upon the best score so far. If this patience threshold is reached, the training is terminated.\n",

    "We will look at a common initialisation strategy often referred to as Xavier or Glorot initialisation, after the lead author of the paper that first proposed it ([Glorot 2010](#Glorot10)). The idea behind this initialisation strategy is to choose a distribution from which we can sample the initial weight values, in such a way that it ensures a strong signal is able to propagate both forwards and backwards through the network in the backpropagation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, this initialisation strategy consists of choosing a univariate distribution with zero mean that each of the weight parameters can be independently sampled from. As we will see, we will need to control the variance of this weight distribution to ensure good signal flow. The biases do not play an important role, and we initialise all bias terms to zero.\n",

This saturation of activation values lasts for a long time in the training, suggesting that the gradients that are being computed are very small, and things only start picking up again at around epoch 100. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis made in the paper is that the root of the problem is a bad initial set of parameters, which doesn't allow a strong training signal to be propagated to all the layers of the network. In particular, at the start of training there is a strong signal, or gradient for the parameters in the last hidden layer, but this gradient diminishes very quickly as you go backwards down the layers. \n",

    "The figures below show histograms of activation values (left), and gradient values (right). The top and bottom rows show histograms for these values without and with Xavier initialisation respectively. \n",

    "The top left figure shows that in the lower layers there is a good spread of activation values. However, as you go deeper into the network these activations start to shrink, because the sigmoid activations are starting to saturate. This can be interpreted as the forward signal being diminished as you go through the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top right figure shows the reverse for the gradients. The deepest hidden layer has the largest spread of values, but by the time the error has been backpropagated to the first hidden layer, the signal is significantly smaller.\n",
    "\n",
