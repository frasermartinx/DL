    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this module we have covered many of the fundamental building blocks of deep learning: from mathematical neurons and multilayer perceptrons, to optimisation and regularisation of deep learning models, and important architectures such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remaining weeks of the module, we will use these building blocks to focus our attention on the probabilistic approach to deep learning. This is a branch of deep learning that aims to make use of tools from probability theory to account for noise and uncertainty in the data. Probabilistic deep learning models make direct use of probability distributions and latent random variables in the model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week of the course we will begin to familiarise ourselves with the [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/) (TFP) library, which is built on TensorFlow to enable a closer integration between deep learning, probabilistic modelling and statistical analysis. In particular, we will learn about `Distribution` and `Bijector` objects in TFP.\n",
    "\n",
    "These objects will provide the tools we need to develop normalising flow deep learning models. Normalising flows are a class of generative models, that were first popularised in the context of variational inference by [Rezende & Mohamed 2015](#Rezende15), and in the context of density estimation by [Dinh et al 2015](#Dinh15). In this week, we will focus on using normalising flows to estimate continuous data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When trained as a density estimator, this type of model is able to produce new instances that could plausibly have come from the same dataset that it is trained on, as well as tell you whether a given example instance is likely. However, for complex datasets the data distribution can be very difficult to model, so this is a highly nontrivial task in general. This is where the power of deep learning models can be leveraged to learn highly multimodal and complicated data distributions, and this type of model has been successfully applied to domains such as image generation ([Ho et al 2019](#Ho19)), noise modelling ([Abdelhamed et al 2019](#Abdelhamed19)), audio synthesis ([Prenger et al 2019](#Prenger19)), and video generation ([Kumar et al 2019](#Kumar19)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week, we will see how to construct autoregressive normalising flow architectures, including the masked autoregressive flow ([Papamakarios et al 2017](#Papamakarios17))."

    "## Change of variables formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken by normalising flows to solve the density estimation task is to take an initial, simple density, and transform it - possibly using a series of parameterised transformations - to produce a rich and complex distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "If these transformations are smooth and invertible, then we are able to evaluate the density of the complex transformed distribution. This property is important, because it then allows to train such a model using maximum likelihood. This is the idea behind normalising flows. The invertible transformations themselves are what constitute the bijectors module in the Tensorflow Probability library.\n",

    "We'll start this week by reviewing the change of variables formula, which forms the mathematical basis of normalising flows.\n",
